# Project Overview

Project Name: FocusTime Analyzer

Description: A web-based dashboard that analyzes data from a user's chosen time tracking app (e.g., Toggl Track, Clockify) to provide insights into their deep work habits, focusing on identifying peak focus times and patterns.

Features:

*   Time Tracking App Integration: Connects to a time tracking app via readily available APIs. (The specific app will be chosen based on API ease of use.)
*   Time of Day Focus Analysis: Visualizes total time spent in focused work at different times of the day.
*   Weekly Heatmap: Displays a heatmap showing focus times across the week, highlighting days and times with the most concentrated work.
*   Day Comparison: Allows users to compare focus times on different days of the week to identify trends.

Target Audience: Individuals who want to understand their deep work patterns and optimize their schedule for maximum productivity.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web dashboard.
*   API integration with a time tracking app.
*   Data analysis and visualization libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to create interactive charts and heatmaps.
